  ############ Networking ############

  # This makes the VM appear as a host with the desinated IP to the local
  # machine.  (e.g. this allows accessing http services running within the
  # VM from the local OS like http://10.11.8.11/whatever).  This MUST be 
  # enabled if the VM is to shared folders to the native machine via NFS 
  # or SMB.  
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "10.11.8.11"

  # This forwards certain ports on the VM to the local host, so that they
  # appear to be originating from the local host (e.g. this allows accessing
  # http services from the local OS like http://localhost:8080/whatever)
  #config.vm.network "forwarded_port",

  ########## File sharing ################

  # NFS or SMB shared folders
  #
  # Alternate NFS or SMB configuration of LOCAL folders shared with the VM. 
  # This causes your local machine to serve as an NFS or SMB server, sharing
  # the contents of the specified directory with the VM.  *nix and MacOS
  # hosts must use NFS, Windows must use SMB.  Windows hosts must have
  # PowerShell 3 installed
  #
  # This option should provide better performance and reliability than
  # Virtualbox file shares, but may have security implications as it turns your
  # local host into a file server.
  #
  # See: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/synced-folders/nfs.html
  # See: https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/synced-folders/smb.html
  #
  # To use this, un-comment the below lines, and comment out the
  # Virtualbox shared folders lines above.
  #if Vagrant::Util::Platform.windows?
  #  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", type: "smb"
  #else
  #  config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/vagrant", 
  #  :nfs => true,
  #  :mount_options => ['rw']
  #end

  
  # VM hosted folders
  #
  # This causes the VM to share the entire "/shared" directory via SMB
  # (Windows file shares).  If you mount the share on your local machine, you
  # can read or write to it.  This can be used regardless of whether the
  # contents of /shared primarily reside on the local host OS (and are 
  # shared with the VM), or if the contents of /shared are hosted on the VM
  # and shared with the local host.  
  #config.vm.provision "shell", path: "dockerhost/samba.sh"


  # This specifies the image to run in the VM
  config.vm.define "dockerhost"
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"

  # This specifies that we want virtualbox to run the VM image, with
  # a given amount of RAM.
